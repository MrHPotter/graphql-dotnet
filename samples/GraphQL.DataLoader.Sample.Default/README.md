A small sample Project. Where we have a very rudamentary Car Dealership, managed in SQLite and we use the Dataloader to Load the Salespeople by Name, in Case we want multiple, aswell as their SubGraph of Assigned Cars, exposing this as a GraphQl Server with the GraphQL.Server.All Package and Altair Ui.
