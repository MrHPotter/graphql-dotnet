## Source:
https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet/issues/1211

A sample project showcasing a basic car dealership system. The dealership is managed using SQLite, with data loading optimized by employing data loaders to fetch salespeople by name. This also supports retrieving their associated subgraph of assigned cars. The project is exposed as a GraphQL server using the `GraphQL.Server.All` package, and includes the Altair UI for interactive querying.
